There has been much buzz amongst football fanatics on the subject of home attendance and team records.  Does the NFL favor teams with low attendance with the goal of boosting fan buy-in with a winning record?  
                    Does this have any weight on the calls of the referees?  

                    In order to answer some questions, we must first find out if there even is a correlation between record and attendance.  
                    To do this, we will first scrap https://www.pro-football-reference.com/> for attendance and team data.  
                    We will also scrape https://www.nfl.com/ for team records.  Looking at 2015-2019 season data, we should be able to see if there is a meaningful correlation or                     not.
